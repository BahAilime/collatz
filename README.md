# Collatz conjecture visualisation

The Collatz conjecture concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows:
- If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term.
- If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.

The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.
